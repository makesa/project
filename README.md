# project
my code Louisville project

This is a Web Page showcasing 12 graphics I have previously created.
I have a J-Query lightbox to display those graphics.
For my custom javascript I just created 2 buttons to change the styles of 2 items on my Web page.
I did inline styles to those 2 buttons.  The rest of my styles are in my css design and layout pages.
